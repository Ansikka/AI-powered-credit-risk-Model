# AI-Powered Credit Risk Modeling with GenAI 

📌 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Credit Risk Modeling pipeline to estimate the Probability of Default (PD) for consumer loans and extends it with a GenAI-powered Decision Intelligence layer using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system not only predicts credit risk using machine learning models but also explains underwriting decisions by retrieving internal credit policies and risk documentation, enabling interpretable and policy-aligned loan decisions.

🏦 Business Context

In consumer lending, incorrect risk assessment can lead to:
High default rates (financial loss)
Over-strict rejection (lost revenue)
This project addresses both by:
Optimizing recall to correctly identify risky customers
Translating ML outputs into business-understandable explanations
